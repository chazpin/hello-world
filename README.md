Hey there! 

Chazpin reporting for coding duty! 
I'm looking to learn some coding basics to increase my data and statistical analysis skills. 
I do have an interest in some web development and software programming as well, but that would only be for personal use. 
Also, have you ever tried Mars tacos?
